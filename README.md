# ggtd (Gabe's Getting Things Done)

A collection of productivity tools. Human software + computer software. Inspired by David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) and other ideas.
Written by a not-particularly-productive person who likes systematization and config tweaking. Maybe a little more meta-work will make the object-work happen automatically ;)

### Includes:
- A set of templates for structuring work into Areas, Projects, and Tasks, and for structuring meta-work into Notes, Questions, and Procedures.
  - Area: An ongoing area of responsibility with no clearly defined stopping point
  - Note: A note, not yet actionable
  - Procedure: A procedure, a routine to be performed repeatedly
  - Project: A scope of work with a defined goal, comprised of multiple Tasks
  - Question: A question, not yet actionable (other than pondering)
  - Task: A single task. Something that can be completed on the order of hours. A scope of work that does not need further breakdown.


### Will hopefully include in the future:
- Compatibility layer between git+GitHub Issues+GitHub Projects and Emacs org-mode
- Human software and templates for [Uncertainty Work](./uncertainty_work.md), an area where I feel that the original GTD lacks specific advice
- Tools for time and project management
- Tools for decision-making

### Influences:
- Getting Things Done -- David Allen
- How to Measure Anything -- Douglas W. Hubbard
