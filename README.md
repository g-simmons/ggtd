# ggtd (Gabe's Getting Things Done)

A collection of productivity tools. Human software + computer software. Inspired by David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) and other ideas.
Written by a not-particularly-productive person who likes systematization and config tweaking. Maybe a little more meta-work will make the object-work happen automatically ;)

Includes:
- A set of templates for structuring work into Areas, Projects, and Tasks, and for structuring meta-work into Notes, Questions, and Procedures.

Will hopefully include in the future:
- Compatibility layer between git+GitHub Issues+GitHub Projects and Emacs org-mode
- Human software and templates for Uncertainty Work, an area where I feel that the original GTD lacks specific advice
- Tools for time and project management
