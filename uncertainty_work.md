At a time I cannot remember, work was just the manipulation of physical objects and no knowledge was involved. 

The dawn of computers and managment consulting ushered in a new form of work, in which _knowledge_ became a first-class object.

The primary responsibility of the _knowledge worker_ is to... work with knowledge. Store knowledge, move it around, organize and index it.

In the physical world, humans interact with matter, but the universe is mostly dark matter. And that's mostly fine. For the average human, the effects of dark matter are not something they need to think about.

In the world of "knowledge work", "knowledge workers" interact with knowledge. But _the knowledge universe is mostly not-knowledge_ -- the knowledge universe is mostly uncertainty. And that's mostly fine. For some "knowledge workers", the effects of uncertainty are not something they need to think about.

But some phenomena in physics cannot be adequately described without accounting for dark matter. Likewise, certain phenomena in knowledge work cannot be adequately described without accounting for uncertainty. 

Some disciplines currently regarded as "knowledge work" are actually dominated by uncertainty. 

Just as knowledge work promoted knowledge to the status of first-class work object, _uncertainty work_ promotes uncertainty to first-class importance.

In uncertainty work, uncertainty is the thing that is worked on. It is a primary object of interest, not just a feature of the environment, not just an annoyance, and not just an obstacle before the "real work" begins. Actions are chosen with their effect on uncertainty as a primary decision factor.

Knowledge workers can reason their way to a correct conclusion. Uncertainty workers must ask the universe.

"How much demand exists for a disruptive product?"
"What experiment should I run in my time alottment on the supercomputer?"
"Why is this high-performing team failing on easy tasks?"

Entrepreneurship, research, and certain kinds of consulting are dominated by uncertainty work.

The science of uncertainty work takes names like _decision theory_. The art of uncertainty work takes names like _night science_. 

Uncertainty work is a class of work worthy of its own recognition, its own tools and techniques, and its own identity.
